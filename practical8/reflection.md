# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I focused on problem-solving using Python by analyzing arrays and strings. I practiced finding the maximum profit from stock prices and determining the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. I also applied techniques like tracking minimum values, using dictionaries, and managing indices efficiently.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to use dictionaries to store the last seen positions of characters, calculate dynamic ranges in strings, and update values conditionally to find optimal results. I also practiced iterating through lists while tracking minimum or maximum values to solve real-world problems like maximizing stock profit.

# What I Learned
I understood how efficient algorithms can reduce computation time by avoiding unnecessary iterations. Using dictionaries for constant-time lookups and updating pointers based on conditions is very effective for string and array problems. These exercises strengthened my ability to approach algorithmic challenges systematically.

# Challenges I Faced
Managing indices correctly while avoiding off-by-one errors was challenging. Ensuring that all edge cases, such as single-element lists or repeated characters, were handled correctly also required careful attention. Working step by step helped me develop more accurate and efficient solutions.
