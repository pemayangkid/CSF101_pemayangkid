# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I focused on algorithmic problem-solving using dynamic programming, bit manipulation, and linked list data structures. I practiced solving the climbing stairs problem using a dynamic approach, counting the number of 1 bits in a binary representation of a number, and reversing a singly linked list using pointer manipulation. These exercises helped me understand how different algorithms efficiently handle data and computation.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to use dynamic programming to store previously computed results in an array to avoid redundant calculations. I also learned how bitwise operations like n &= (n - 1) can be used to count the number of set bits efficiently. Additionally, I practiced reversing a linked list iteratively by keeping track of previous and current nodes to change the direction of links.

# What I Learned
I understood how dynamic programming simplifies problems involving overlapping subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to climb stairs. I learned how bit manipulation offers a fast and memory-efficient way to process binary data. From the linked list exercise, I realized how pointers work in modifying node connections without losing data. Overall, I gained a stronger grasp of how algorithms optimize performance and resource usage.

# Challenges I Faced
Remembering the correct base cases in the dynamic programming approach was initially challenging. Understanding how the n &= (n - 1) operation reduces one set bit at a time also took some analysis. Reversing a linked list required careful pointer tracking to avoid losing node references. Through debugging and testing multiple cases, I improved my logical reasoning and coding accuracy.
