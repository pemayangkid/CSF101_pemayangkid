# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I focused on algorithmic problem-solving using Python. I practiced detecting duplicates in arrays, finding pairs or triplets that meet certain conditions, checking for anagrams, and verifying palindromes. I also applied techniques like hashing, sorting, and the two-pointer method.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to use sets and dictionaries to detect duplicates efficiently, implement two-pointer techniques to solve problems like three-sum and palindrome checking, and count characters to check for anagrams. I also practiced handling edge cases and optimizing algorithms for better performance.

# What I Learned
I realized that algorithmic thinking involves breaking down problems into smaller steps and applying appropriate data structures and techniques. Understanding when to use sets, dictionaries, or pointers can drastically improve efficiency. These exercises strengthened my ability to approach coding problems logically.

# Challenges I Faced
Handling edge cases, such as empty arrays or strings with special characters, was challenging. Implementing two-pointer logic correctly and ensuring no duplicates were included in results also required careful attention. Practicing step by step helped me overcome these challenges and improve my problem-solving skills.
