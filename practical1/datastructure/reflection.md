# Main Concepts
I practiced working with Python lists and dictionaries, including creating lists, accessing elements, appending items, and organizing data with key-value pairs in dictionaries.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to manipulate lists using append() and indexing, and to create and access dictionaries to store multiple attributes of a person.

# What I Learned
I understood how lists and dictionaries help organize and retrieve data efficiently, with lists for sequential storage and dictionaries for associating meaningful keys with values.

# Challenges I Faced
Remembering the correct syntax for dictionaries and accessing values using keys, as well as using the right list indices to access specific items, were minor challenges.
