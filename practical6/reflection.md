# Main Concepts
In this practice I focused on search algorithms, including linear search, iterative binary search, and recursive binary search. The main idea was to understand how different search methods work, how they differ in efficiency, and how the structure of the data affects the search process.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned several important skills during these exercises. Implementing linear search helped me understand the simplest way to find an element in a list by checking each element one by one. Although it is straightforward, I learned that linear search becomes inefficient for large datasets because it examines every element.

Implementing iterative binary search taught me how to efficiently search in a sorted list using a divide and conquer strategy. I practiced managing the left and right pointers, calculating the middle index, and adjusting the pointers depending on whether the target is greater or smaller than the middle element.

I also implemented recursive binary search, which reinforced my understanding of recursion. Handling the base case correctly and ensuring the search moves toward the correct half of the list was challenging but rewarding. Recursive binary search showed me how the same logic can be expressed more elegantly using recursion, although it requires careful tracking of indexes and boundaries.

# What I Learned
I learned that binary search is much faster than linear search for large sorted datasets because it reduces the search space by half in each step. I also learned that recursion can simplify the logic of certain algorithms but requires careful handling of the base case and recursive calls. Linear search is useful for unsorted data or small datasets but is not efficient for large data.

These exercises improved my understanding of how to implement algorithms correctly, how to reason about efficiency, and how data structure choices influence algorithm performance.

# Challenges I Faced
The most challenging part was managing the indexes in iterative and recursive binary search. Calculating the middle index correctly and adjusting the left and right pointers without causing off-by-one errors required careful thinking. In recursive binary search, ensuring the recursion stopped at the correct point and returned the right value was tricky.

Despite these challenges, completing the exercises helped me understand the logic of searching algorithms thoroughly and strengthened my skills in both iterative and recursive problem solving in Python.
