# Main Concepts
In these exercises I focused on problem-solving using pseudocode and flowcharts. The main idea was to translate real-world problems into logical steps that a computer can follow. I worked on calculating the area of a rectangle, converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, and determining whether a number is even or odd.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned how to break down problems into clear, step-by-step instructions using pseudocode. Writing pseudocode for the area of a rectangle required me to identify inputs (length and width), perform a calculation (multiply length and width), and produce an output (area).

Creating a flowchart for the same problem helped me visualize the logic. I learned to represent inputs, processes, and outputs visually using symbols like parallelograms for input/output and rectangles for processes.

For Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion, I practiced using a formula in both pseudocode and a flowchart. This exercise reinforced how formulas can be translated into steps that a computer can execute.

Checking whether a number is even or odd taught me how to use conditional statements in pseudocode and decision symbols in flowcharts. I learned to test a condition (number modulo 2 equals zero) and branch the logic to output the correct result.

# What I Learned
I learned that pseudocode is a useful tool for planning programs before writing actual code. Flowcharts help in understanding the sequence of steps and decision points visually, which makes complex problems easier to solve. These exercises strengthened my logical thinking and made me more confident in designing programs before coding.

# Challenges I Faced

The main challenge was representing conditional logic and loops accurately in flowcharts. Making sure each decision branch leads to the correct process or output required careful planning. For pseudocode, the challenge was to write steps clearly and concisely without mixing it with actual programming syntax.

Overall, these exercises helped me understand problem-solving, logical thinking, and visual representation of algorithms, which are fundamental skills in programming.
