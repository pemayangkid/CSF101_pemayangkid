# Main Concepts
I practiced Python basics including variables, data types, arithmetic operations, logical operators, and string manipulation. I also learned to display outputs using print() and use functions like len().

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to combine conditions using and/or, perform calculations, format strings with concatenation and f-strings, and work with different data types effectively.

# What I Learned
I understood how to use variables and logical expressions to solve problems, create dynamic messages, and check outputs in VS Code to ensure correct results.

# Challenges I Faced
Remembering the syntax for logical operators and formatting strings correctly were the main challenges, as well as ensuring calculations used the correct data types.
