# Main Concepts
I practiced loops (for and while), conditional statements (if, elif, else), functions, and working with lists. I also learned about breaking and continuing loops, and user input with input().

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to use break and continue in loops, define functions (like checking prime numbers), use nested loops, and perform calculations or checks inside loops. I also practiced handling user input and generating random numbers.

# What I Learned
I understood how loops and conditions can control program flow, how functions make code reusable, and how to iterate through lists and ranges effectively. I also learned how to combine loops and conditions to solve problems dynamically.

# Challenges I Faced
Managing nested loops and ensuring conditions are correctly applied was challenging. Handling user input without errors and using break/continue correctly required careful attention.
