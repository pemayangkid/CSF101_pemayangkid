# Main Concepts
In this practice I worked with binary search trees and the linear search algorithm in Python. The main focus was on understanding how data can be organized hierarchically in a tree and how to search efficiently in both structured and unstructured data.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
During this exercise I learned several important skills. I implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) where each node can have up to two children. I practiced inserting values into the tree while maintaining the property that left child nodes are smaller than the parent and right child nodes are larger. Although implementing the recursive insertion and search methods was challenging, it helped me understand the recursive nature of tree traversal.

I also implemented linear search in a list. This helped me understand how searching works in an unstructured sequence of data and why linear search is less efficient compared to structured searches like in a BST.

# What I Learned
I learned that binary search trees are powerful for organizing data because they allow faster search, insertion, and deletion compared to simple lists when the tree is balanced. Understanding recursion is key for operations like insertion and search in trees.

Linear search, on the other hand, is simple but less efficient for large datasets because it checks each element one by one. This exercise helped me appreciate the difference between structured and unstructured data handling and how choosing the right data structure affects performance.

# Challenges I Faced
The most challenging parts were handling recursive insertion and search in the BST. I had to carefully check whether the current node is null and decide whether to move left or right. Another difficulty was understanding the base case in recursion and preventing infinite loops. In linear search, the challenge was minor but involved making sure the function correctly returns the index when the element is found and returns a proper signal when it is not found.

Completing these exercises helped me gain a strong understanding of tree structures, recursion, and search algorithms and improved my ability to implement more complex data structures in Python.
