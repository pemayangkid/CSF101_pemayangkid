# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I focused on Python operators, including arithmetic, assignment, logical, and comparison operators. I practiced performing calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division. I also explored how assignment operators can modify variables and how logical and comparison operators evaluate conditions.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to use arithmetic operators to perform various calculations, apply assignment operators to update variable values, use logical operators to combine boolean values, and compare values using comparison operators. I also practiced combining these operators in expressions and interpreting their results.

# What I Learned
I understood how Python operators work to perform calculations, modify variables, and evaluate conditions. I realized that logical operators help in decision-making, while comparison operators are useful for checking relationships between values. Practicing these operators strengthened my understanding of basic Python operations.

# Challenges I Faced
Remembering the differences between similar operators, such as / and // or == and !=, required careful attention. Understanding how boolean logic evaluates in different expressions also took some practice. Working through examples step by step helped me overcome these challenges.
