# Main Concepts
In this practice I worked with different types of linked lists in Python. I implemented singly linked lists, circular linked lists, and doubly linked lists. The main focus was on understanding how nodes are connected, how to insert and delete nodes at different positions, and how the structure of the list affects operations.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
During this exercise I learned several advanced skills. I implemented a Circular Linked List where the last node connects back to the head. This was challenging because I had to manage insertion at both the beginning and the end while maintaining the circular connection. Deleting a node in a circular list also required careful handling of special cases like deleting the head or when there is only one node.

I also created a Doubly Linked List, which allows navigation in both directions. I learned how to insert and delete nodes at the front and end while keeping both next and previous references consistent. Displaying the list forward and backward helped me understand the importance of correctly updating the node references.

For the Singly Linked List, I practiced inserting nodes at the front and end, deleting nodes from the front, and searching for elements. This helped me understand the basic structure and operations of linked lists and how they differ from arrays or Python lists.

# What I Learned
I learned that linked lists are flexible data structures that allow dynamic memory usage and efficient insertion and deletion. Circular linked lists are useful when the data needs to loop continuously. Doubly linked lists are helpful when traversal in both directions is needed, but they require careful handling of node references. Singly linked lists are simpler but still require attention when inserting, deleting, or searching nodes.

Through these exercises I also realized the importance of handling edge cases such as empty lists, deleting the only node, or updating references correctly when modifying the list. Writing these classes from scratch helped me understand how linked lists work internally and improved my problem solving skills.

# Challenges I Faced
Some parts were particularly difficult. In circular linked lists, maintaining the connection from the last node to the head during insertion and deletion was tricky. In doubly linked lists, updating both next and previous references correctly while inserting or deleting nodes required careful thinking. Searching for nodes and handling empty lists in all types of linked lists also required attention.

Despite these challenges, completing these exercises helped me gain a strong understanding of linked list structures and operations and made me more confident in implementing complex data structures in Python.
