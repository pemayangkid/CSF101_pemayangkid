# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I focused on data structures, particularly stacks. I practiced implementing a stack using a queue and checking the validity of brackets in strings. I learned how to use a stack to keep track of elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order and how this can help solve problems like balanced parentheses.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to implement a stack using two queues and perform standard operations such as push, pop, top, and empty. I also learned how to use a stack to validate brackets efficiently, mapping opening and closing brackets and checking for correct nesting.

# What I Learned
I understood the importance of stacks in managing LIFO data and solving problems that require backtracking or nested structure validation. Using stacks allows algorithms to efficiently check conditions that would be difficult to handle with simple lists or arrays.

# Challenges I Faced
Implementing a stack using queues required careful management of the order of elements. Ensuring the bracket validation algorithm correctly handled all edge cases, such as mismatched or out-of-order brackets, was also challenging. Practicing these exercises helped me develop stronger problem-solving skills with data structures.
