# Main Concepts
In this practice I worked with different data structures in Python including Deque, Queue, Stack, and lists. The main focus was on learning how to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently and understanding how each structure behaves differently depending on its rules and design.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
During this exercise I learned several important skills. I implemented a Deque class to allow adding and removing elements from both the front and the rear which was challenging because I had to manage cases when the deque was empty. I also created a Queue class from scratch which helped me understand the first in first out principle and how to safely handle elements when the queue is empty.

I built a Stack class to practice last in first out operations including push, pop, and peek. Handling situations where the stack is empty was difficult at first. I also used Python list methods such as append, extend, insert, remove, pop, and slicing and explored list comprehensions to generate new lists like the squares of numbers. I learned how to handle errors in custom classes to prevent crashes when accessing or removing elements from empty structures.

# What I Learned
I learned that choosing the right data structure is very important for solving problems efficiently. Deques are flexible because they allow adding and removing elements from both ends but they require careful handling when empty. Queues are useful for tasks that need strict order such as scheduling or processing items sequentially. Stacks are useful for tasks that require reverse order operations like undo features in applications.

Working on these classes helped me understand how these data structures work internally and why handling errors is important. I also learned that lists in Python are very versatile and methods like slicing, sorting, and comprehensions make it easy to manipulate and analyze data.

# Challenges I Faced
Some parts were difficult. Managing empty cases in Deque, Queue, and Stack classes was tricky. Remembering the differences between first in first out for queues and last in first out for stacks was challenging at first. Implementing front, rear, and peek operations correctly while preventing errors required careful thinking. Using list comprehensions and slicing efficiently without making mistakes also took time to master.

Despite these challenges I was able to complete the exercises and my understanding of data structures in Python and my programming skills improved significantly.
