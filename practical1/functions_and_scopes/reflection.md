# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I focused on Python functions, including defining and calling functions, using parameters, default values, and keyword arguments. I also explored recursion through factorial and Fibonacci functions, and practiced understanding variable scope with local, global, and nonlocal variables.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned to create reusable functions with parameters, return values, and default arguments. I practiced writing recursive functions to solve mathematical problems like factorials and Fibonacci sequences. I also learned how variable scope works in Python, including the difference between local, global, and nonlocal variables.

# What I Learned
I realized how functions make code modular and easier to maintain. Recursion allows solving problems elegantly, though it requires careful planning to avoid errors. Understanding variable scope helps prevent unintended side effects and ensures that functions behave as expected.

# Challenges I Faced
Understanding recursion and tracking the flow of recursive calls was challenging at first. Managing variable scope, especially with global and nonlocal variables, required careful attention to avoid overwriting values or creating unexpected results. Despite these challenges, practicing each concept step by step helped me gain confidence in writing functions in Python.
