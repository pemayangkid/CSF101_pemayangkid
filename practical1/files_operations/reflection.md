# Main Concepts
In these exercises, I explored Python file handling, working with both text and binary files. I practiced creating, reading, writing, and appending data to files. I also learned how to check if files exist, rename or delete them, copy files, create directories, and list directory contents. Additionally, I worked with CSV files to read and organize structured data efficiently.

# New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I learned how to manipulate files safely using different modes like read, write, append, and binary. I gained experience using Python modules like os and shutil for file and directory operations. I also practiced working with CSV files, numbering lines in a file, counting words, and appending new content without overwriting existing data.

# What I Learned
I realized how powerful Python is for managing files and organizing data. Working with CSV files taught me how to handle structured information easily, and I understood how proper file handling prevents data loss. Overall, these exercises strengthened my confidence in using Python for practical tasks involving data storage and management.

# Challenges I Faced
Initially, remembering the correct modes for opening files and using the right syntax for modules like os, shutil, and csv was tricky. I also had to be careful when performing operations like renaming or deleting files to avoid errors. Despite these challenges, practicing step by step helped me gain a clear understanding of file handling in Python.
